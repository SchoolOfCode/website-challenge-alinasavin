# Website Challenge

## Overview

For your first project on the bootcamp, we want you to make a website all about your pair partner using HTML and CSS.

The person you are making your website for is your partner, aka The Client. It is your job as a programmer to understand what the client wants from a profile site, assess what information is available and useful, design what serves the audience of users (aka the other bootcampers) best from the experience, and then create something which best solves those needs. You won't be given any guidance of what to build - you'll need to empathise with your users to see what they would find useful (or even survey and talk to them), and plan your site accordingly.

## Outcome

- a single web page created with HTML and CSS
- a profile describing your client
- a short 1-page README.md file alongside it which describes how you went about the project (your thoughts, research, plans, and justification for decisions)

## Extra

This is not only a chance for you to practice the core skills of HTML and CSS, but also a chance to invest time in thinking about how to build a website for a client, and have a user-centric approach - a key learning objective of the course. You will need to actively communicate with the client to find out everything you need in order to design and build a website which represents them to the rest of the cohort.

Although you will each have an individual repository in which to make the website, there is nothing stopping you pair programming with your partner on the project. Organise your time so that you can spend an equal amount of time on each project. For example, if you spend three hours coding together on Sunday, you would spend 1.5 hours pair programming on one site, before moving over to the other site.

This project will span the first two weeks of the bootcamp, and you will be given time in live evening sessions to work on it as well.

## Initial set up 

I had an initial meeting with _The client_ where we got to know each other a bit better. During the same session we layed out the plan and set up following objectives as:

* get to know each other 
* reasearch layout design 
* create survey with layout options and color pallets
* create survey to gather more content info
* create wireframe
* present and check wireframe with _The client_
* exchange info and photos needed for the page
* schedule regular meeting for pair programming 

While doing the reasearch we had regular meetings to discuss around what we are doing, our progress and next steps. 

## Info gathering

I used [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc07OIUW2kmO5TVBpccaRN8i7zCpBwx8GgLBAIkaXsaB--37Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) for Kate to pick her favourite layout and collor pallete. I used [W3School] (https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_palettes.asp) for the color pallete options.
